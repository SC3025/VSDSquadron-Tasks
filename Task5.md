MINI PROJECTS USING VSD SQUADRON BOARDS


1. SERIAL LIGHTING OF LED'S
   -------------------------------------------

Serial lighting of LEDs using the VSD Squadron Board involves turning on LEDs one after another in a sequence, creating a chasing light effect.
This is achieved by programming the board to control multiple GPIO pins, sequentially toggling them HIGH and LOW with a delay between each transition. 
Using simple digitalWrite() functions, each LED is activated for a short duration before switching to the next, cycling through all LEDs in a loop. 
This effect is commonly used in LED animations, indicator systems, and decorative lighting. If needed, PWM control can be added for brightness variation, 
creating a fading effect instead of abrupt ON/OFF transitions.


Code:


-----------------------------------------------------
#define LED_COUNT 5
#define LED_COUNT 5  // Number of LEDs

// Define LED pins 
const int LED_PINS[LED_COUNT] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; 

void setup() {
    // Initialize all LED pins as OUTPUT
    for (int i = 0; i < LED_COUNT; i++) {
        pinMode(LED_PINS[i], OUTPUT);
        digitalWrite(LED_PINS[i], LOW); // Start with all LEDs OFF
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Turn LEDs ON one by one in sequence
    for (int i = 0; i < LED_COUNT; i++) {
        digitalWrite(LED_PINS[i], HIGH); // Turn ON LED
        delay(300);  // Wait for 300ms
        digitalWrite(LED_PINS[i], LOW);  // Turn OFF LED
    }

    
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🔹 Components Used:
VSD Squadron Board – A development board used for embedded systems, microcontroller-based applications, and IoT projects.
LTC3588 Energy Harvester – Converts low-power energy from solar panels or piezoelectric elements into a regulated voltage (e.g., 3.3V or 5V).
Solar Panel – Captures sunlight and generates a small DC voltage (typically 3V-6V), which is fed into the LTC3588.
Piezoelectric Element – Converts mechanical vibrations into AC power, which is rectified and stored for use.
Capacitor (e.g., 200µF - 1000µF) – Stores charge from the energy harvester, stabilizing voltage output and allowing short bursts of power when needed.
🔋 How Power Flows Through the System

1️⃣ The solar panel or piezoelectric element generates power.


2️⃣ The LTC3588 harvests and regulates this power to a stable 3.3V or 5V output.


3️⃣ A capacitor smooths fluctuations and stores energy to provide continuous power.



4️⃣ The VSD Squadron Board is connected to the LTC3588 VCC (3.3V or 5V) and GND, enabling it to operate even if the energy input is unstable.

💡 How to Power an LED or Perform Other Tasks on the VSD Squadron Board
Powering an LED:
Connect an LED to a GPIO pin and control it using digitalWrite() in Arduino code.

------------------------------------------------------------
pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(2, HIGH);  // Turn LED ON
delay(500);
digitalWrite(2, LOW);   // Turn LED OFF
delay(500);




---------------------------------------------------
Running Other Tasks:
The VSD Squadron Board can perform basic tasks, such as reading sensors, running displays, or controlling motors.
Energy usage should be optimized to prevent draining stored power too quickly.
🚀 Summary
Using an LTC3588 energy harvester with a solar panel or piezoelectric element, we can generate and regulate power to operate the VSD Squadron Board. A capacitor helps store and stabilize energy, allowing the board to power LEDs, sensors, and other embedded applications while relying on harvested energy.


-------------------------------------------------------
The LTC3588 Energy Harvester is responsible for converting small amounts of energy (from solar, piezoelectric, etc.) into a stable voltage output (e.g., 3.3V or 5V). However, it cannot provide instant high power when a load (like the VSD Squadron Board) suddenly draws current.

This is where the capacitor comes in: ✅ Energy Storage:

The capacitor stores charge when power is available, allowing it to release energy quickly when needed.
If the energy harvester supplies very low current, the capacitor acts as a power reserve.
✅ Smoothing Voltage Fluctuations:

Some energy sources (like solar panels in changing light conditions) do not provide constant power.
The capacitor stabilizes the output voltage, preventing dips that could cause system failures.
✅ Helps With Power Bursts:

If your circuit (e.g., microcontroller) suddenly needs more power, the capacitor delivers the extra energy instantly, while the harvester catches up.
