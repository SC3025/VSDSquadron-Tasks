GTKWave is a waveform viewer that displays the simulation results
in an intuitive graphical format, helping users analyze signal changes over time, zoom in on specific events,
and debug their designs. Together, these tools provide a complete simulation and verification environment, 
with Iverilog handling the simulation and GTKWave making it easier to interpret the results.

for simulation, we use a verilog netlist and testbench. a .vcd file is generated, and the output waveforms are simulated using gtkwave.
